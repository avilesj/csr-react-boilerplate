# Client Side Rendering React + StyledComponents with Webpack

This is my boilerplate so I don't have to deal wtih webpack setup again, for a while... for javascript :D

Includes:

- React
- React Router
- Dotenv
- Webpack with:
  - file-loader
  - Webpack-dev-server:
  	- HMR
	- react-hot-loader
## TODO       
- Jest
- ESLint
- Rimraf

# Important

This requires a .env file
