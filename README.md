# Client Side Rendering React + Redux + StyledComponents with Webpack

This is my boilerplate so I don't have to deal wtih webpack setup again, for a while... for javascript :D

Includes:

- React
- React Router
- Redux
- Dotenv
- ESLint
- Rimraf
- Webpack with:
  - file-loader
  - Webpack-dev-server:
  	- HMR
	- react-hot-loader
## TODO       
- Jest

# Important

This requires a .env file
